\begin{enumerate}

\set{1.2}
\item \calculator\ Let's examine the function: $\eq1$.

\item this is the symble for the set of all real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$

\item this is the symble for the set of all integers: $\mathbb{Z}$

\item this is the symble for the set of all rationals: $\mathbb{Q}$

\item Interpret the effects: Which actor types clearly tend towards the pro-regulation camp?
Which actor types tend towards the anti-regulation camp? For which actor types can
we not be sure? Where are European Union actors on the ideological scale? What
else can we learn from the model about cross-policy involvement, actors' activity, and
their vagueness of stated beliefs? Interpret the non-linear relationship by looking at
the polynomial coefficients.\\

\item Healthy group (International Health Bodies, NHS/Professional Associations and Health Advocacy Groups) clearly tend towards the pro-regulation camp. \\
Retailers and their Associations and Manufacturers tend towards the anti-regulation camp. \\
